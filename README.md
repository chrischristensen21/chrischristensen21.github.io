# Weather Analysis Web Design

## Background

The purpose of this project was to visually display the results of a previously performed weather analysis through a basic user friendly website designed using CSS and bootstrap deployed by GitHub pages: https://chrischristensen21.github.io/index.html

### Website Information

The website consists of 7 total pages:

* A Landing Page with an explanation of the project and a navigation bar with links to the other 6 pages. 
* Four visualization pages containing plots of various weather-related phenomenon with a short description of any obvious findings or trends. .
* A comparisons page that allows you to  view all of the plots side by side for easy comparison
* A Data Page containing a table with all the data used for the analyses.

The user can either navigate through the navigation bar or click on any of the plot images, which will also direct them to the corresponding page containing the information of that plot.
